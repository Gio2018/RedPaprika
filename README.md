# Red Paprika Recipes App
Welcome to Red Paprika, a super simple app that collects recipes around the  world.

## Summary
Red Paprika is a simple MVP of a recipe app, built with SwiftUI, SwiftData and simplicity in mind.
### main features
- Access a list of recipes from around the world, sorted by cuisine type.
    - you can scroll vertically through cuisines, and horizontally through recipes of a specific cuisine
- Tap on a recipe card to view the web page of the recipe itself, to learn more about ingredients and any other detail
- Tap on the **watch** button on the bottom-right of each recipe card to watch a YouTube video of the recipe
- Pull-to-refresh to refresh the recipe list at any time
- The app handles situations like errors from the backend: to simulate this, you can build this project from Xcode and in the file `RecipeService.swift` change the designated endpoint to see how the app handles these states.
